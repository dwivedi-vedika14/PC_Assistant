# -A-simple-PC-Assistant-
Created a personal PC/Laptop assistant which works on voice command and can perform basic but important tasks. It is completely developed in python by taking support of modules like selenium, pyttsx3, speech_recognition etc. Its functionality included tasks like shutting down the PC, giving information about the weather outside, loging in various social media platforms, opening webcam etc. Assistant can also reply back if needed using voice command.

The project has two modules one is the main which is responsible for the voice recognition and function calling
the second module has the functions and a dictinary that stores them. This project is completely in python.
